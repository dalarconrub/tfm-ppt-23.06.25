	abstract = {On-line discussion forums constitute communities of people learning from each other, which not only inform the students about their peers’ doubts and problems but can also inform instructors about their students’ knowledge of the course contents. In fact, nowadays there is increasing interest in the use of discussion forums as an indicator of student performance. In this respect, this paper proposes the use of different data mining approaches for improving prediction of students’ ﬁnal performance starting from participation indicators in both quantitative, qualitative and social network forums. Our objective is to determine how the selection of instances and attributes, the use of different classiﬁcation algorithms and the date when data is gathered affect the accuracy and comprehensibility of the prediction. A new Moodle’s module for gathering forum indicators was developed and different executions were carried out using real data from 114 university students during a ﬁrst-year course in computer science. A representative set of traditional classiﬁcation algorithms have been used and compared versus classiﬁcation via clustering algorithms for predicting whether students will pass or fail the course on the basis of data about their forum usage. The results obtained indicate the suitability of performing both a ﬁnal prediction at the end of the course and an early prediction before the end of the course; of applying clustering plus class association rules mining instead of traditional classiﬁcation for obtaining highly interpretable student performance models; and of using a subset of attributes instead of all available attributes, and not all forum messages but only students’ messages with content related to the subject of the course for improving classiﬁcation accuracy.},

	abstract = {To ensure online collaborative learning meets the intended pedagogical goals (is actually collaborative and stimulates learning), mechanisms are needed for monitoring the efficiency of online collaboration. Various studies have indicated that social network analysis can be particularly effective in studying students’ interactions in online collaboration. However, research in education has only focused on the theoretical potential of using SNA, not on the actual benefits they achieved. This study investigated how social network analysis can be used to monitor online collaborative learning, find aspects in need of improvement, guide an informed intervention, and assess the efficacy of intervention using an experimental, observational repeated-measurement design in three courses over a full-term duration. Using a combination of SNA-based visual and quantitative analysis, we monitored three SNA constructs for each participant: the level of interactivity, the role, and position in information exchange, and the role played by each participant in the collaboration. On the group level, we monitored interactivity and group cohesion indicators. Our monitoring uncovered a noncollaborative teacher-centered pattern of interactions in the three studied courses as well as very few interactions among students, limited information exchange or negotiation, and very limited student networks dominated by the teacher. An intervention based on SNA-generated insights was designed. The intervention was structured into five actions: increasing awareness, promoting collaboration, improving the content, preparing teachers, and finally practicing with feedback. Evaluation of the intervention revealed that it has significantly enhanced student-student interactions and teacher-student interactions, as well as produced a collaborative pattern of interactions among most students and teachers. Since efficient and communicative activities are essential prerequisites for successful content discussion and for realizing the goals of collaboration, we suggest that our SNA-based approach will positively affect teaching and learning in many educational domains. Our study offers a proof-of-concept of what SNA can add to the current tools for monitoring and supporting teaching and learning in higher education.},

	abstract = {Do studies show that physical and online students’ social networks support education? Analyzing interactions between students in schools and universities can provide a wealth of information. Studies on students’ social networks can help us understand their behavioral dynamics, the correlation between their friendships and academic performance, community and group formation, information diffusion, and so on. Educational goals and holistic development of students with various academic abilities and backgrounds can be achieved by incorporating the ﬁndings attained by the studies in terms of knowledge propagation in classroom and spread of delinquent behaviors. Moreover, we use Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify isolated students, ascertain the group study culture, analyze the spreading of various habits like smoking, drinking, and so on. In this paper, we present a review of the research showing how analysis of students’ social networks can help us identify how improved educational methods can be used to make learning more inclusive at both school and university levels and achieve holistic development of students through expansion of their social networks, as well as control the spread of delinquent behaviors.},

	abstract = {Online peer assessment tasks are very popular and have unique characteristics that improve learning and encourage social interactions in a distance education environment. Unfortunately, social factors have usually been ignored in the process of selecting reviewers for online peer assessment tasks. We hypothesize that this fact could have some inﬂuence on the lack of engagement and participation by some learners. For this reason, we propose an approach in which social network analysis techniques, expert criteria and Bayesian reasoning are applied to select reviewers with the objective of increasing participation in peer review tasks. The approach is divided into two elements. On the one hand, we have developed an inﬂuence diagram template that structures a set of proposed social network analysis variables in accordance with expert criteria. This inﬂuence diagram template can be easily updated for any course simply by eliciting a minimal set of parameters. On the other hand, we have instantiated the proposed inﬂuence diagram template to produce an inﬂuence diagram network to quantify the quality of reviewer assignment for an online peer assessment task. In an online experiment, we veriﬁed that the consideration of social factors can increase participation in a peer assessment task.},

In particular, the blended learning is considered a useful methodology for supporting and understanding students and their learning issues. Thanks to e-Learning platforms and their collaborative tools, students can interact with other students and share doubts on certain topics. However, teachers often remain outside of this process and do not understand the learning problems that are in their classrooms. A solution for ensuring the privacy of communication among students could be the adoption of a Sentiment Analysis methodology for the detection of the classroom mood during the learning process. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of a probabilistic approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as Sentiment Grabber. The proposed approach can detect the mood of students on the various topics and teacher can better tune his/her teaching approach. The proposed method has been tested in real cases with effective and satisfactory results.},
