	abstract = {Social network theory has made major contributions to our understanding of human social organisation but has found relatively little application in the field of animal behaviour. In this review, we identify several broad research areas where the networks approach could greatly enhance our understanding of social patterns and processes in animals. The network theory provides a quantitative framework that can be used to characterise social structure both at the level of the individual and the population. These novel quantitative variables may provide a new tool in addressing key questions in behavioural ecology particularly in relation to the evolution of social organisation and the impact of social structure on evolutionary processes. For example, network measures could be used to compare social networks of different species or populations making full use of the comparative approach. However, the networks approach can in principle go beyond identifying structural patterns and also can help with the understanding of processes within animal populations such as disease transmission and information transfer. Finally, understanding the pattern of interactions in the network (i.e. who is connected to whom) can also shed some light on the evolution of behavioural strategies.},

	abstract = {Structural balance theory attends to a group’s network of sentiments and posits that this network alters over time toward particular structural forms. Current work on the theory is focused on understanding the mechanisms that alter sentiments as a function of the configuration of sentiments in which they are embedded. Although the theory assumes tension reduction mechanisms, there has been no effort to directly measure and model the temporal changes of individuals’ relational tensions that are predicted by the theory. This article elaborates and tests balance theory with an empirical analysis of its posited interpersonal tensions and their reductions via a sentiment conversion process. In addition, the authors open a new line of inquiry on the theory’s scope conditions and point to a community commitment condition that is involved in the realization of structural balance. Their analysis draws on a unique suite of multiwave measures obtained from the Urban Communes Data Set.},

abstract = {Learning and educational challenges in the field of indoor climate and building services like energy systems are mainly due to the transformation of professional practices and learning networks, a big shift in the way in which people work, communicate, and share their knowledge and the need for additional workforce, either juniors or coming from other disciplines. One of the most important factors that highly influence professional development and workplace learning is networked learning. Our goal in this study, is understanding the learning networks characteristics and patterns of interaction using Social Network Analysis techniques in three MOOCs discussion forums. The result of this study shows not only the importance of Learning networks and peer support on professionalization of learners, but also how pedagogical approach of instructors in MOOCs can foster learning networks. This novel approach in developing learning networks and communities is not only able to help connect young professionals and experienced practitioners digitally, but also it can promote professional development and innovation in the energy installation sector.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the student’s behaviour in relation to their degree of commitment, participation, and contribution in a MOOC based on a social learning approach. Interaction data was collected on the learning platform and in social networks, both of which were used in the third edition of a social MOOC course. This data was then studied via statistical methods and analysis of social networks. This study assumes that social communities would arise around the course, would remain over time, and that participants would even contribute with new proposals. The findings indicated that social learning communities are built and continue only while the course is open and while the teachers are involved in fostering participation. Although this study is limited, the design criteria of the course, the pedagogical model on which this is supported, and the methods applied for this analysis provide other researchers and educators with clues for better understand the dynamic process of social learning in social MOOCs.},

	abstract = {One of the characteristics of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) is that the overall number of social interactions tend to be higher than in traditional courses, hindering the analysis of social learning. Learners typically ask or answer questions using the MOOC forum. This makes messages a rich source of information, which can be used to infer learners’ behaviour and outcomes. It is not feasible for teachers to process all forum messages and automated tools and analysis are required. Although there are some tools for analysing learners’ interactions, there is a need for methodologies and integrated tools that help to interpret the learning process based on social interactions in the forum. This work presents the 3S (Social, Sentiments, Skills) learning analytics methodology for analysing forum interactions in MOOCs. This methodology considers a temporal analysis combining the social, sentiments and skill dimensions that can be extracted from forum data. We also introduce LATƎS, a Learning Analytics tool for edX / Open edX related to the three dimensions (3S), which includes visualisations related to the three dimensions to guide the proposed methodology. We apply the 3S methodology and the tool to a MOOC on Java programming. Results showed, among others, the action-reaction effect produced when learners increase their participation after instructor's events. Moreover, a decrease of positive sentiments over time and before deadlines of openended assignments was also observed and that there were certain skills which caused more troubles (e.g., arrays and loops). These results acknowledge the importance of using a learning analytics methodology to detect problems in MOOCs.},
